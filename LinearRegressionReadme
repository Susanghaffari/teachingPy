In this assignment, there are 2 types of linear regression for the Boston Housing dataset to house value prediction based on some features.
First with one feature(EX: "LSTAT") and in the next section with two features(EX: "black" and "LSTAT"), which is selective. My processing steps for these selections were better on following features: "CRIM" - "AGE" - "LSTAT".
I preferred to use OLS method (Ordinary Least Squares)
as this reference(https://www.cs.toronto.edu/) the features in detail is presented here:
Variables
    There are 14 attributes in each case of the dataset. They are:

        CRIM - per capita crime rate by town
        ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
        INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
        CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
        NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
        RM - average number of rooms per dwelling
        AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
        DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
        RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways
        TAX - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
        PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town
        B - 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
        LSTAT - % lower status of the population
        MEDV - Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's

-Note
    Variable #14 seems to be censored at 50.00 (corresponding to a median price of $50,000); Censoring is suggested by the fact that the highest median price of exactly $50,000 is reported in 16 cases, while 15 cases have prices between $40,000 and $50,000, with prices rounded to the nearest hundred. Harrison and Rubinfeld do not mention any censoring.
